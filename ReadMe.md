Poetry Generation using ML
=========

Intro:
------
The goal is to generate poems with a ML model and understand the behaviour of different models in the meantime. There are multiple model fitted to several hungarian poets' entire publicated work. The trained model hence captures the particular style of the authors and generates text in the same manner.

Models:
------
The model training using 2 layers of [Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit) implemented in tensorflow Keras.
More info in the jupyter notebooks.

Application:
------------
You can check the models in application as a [Heroku service here](https://textgenml.herokuapp.com/)
